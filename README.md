# StoryBack

StoryBack is a web application generated using JHipster 7.8.1, that aims at gathering code samples to achieve feature we
often had to achieve for our clients at [BearStudio](https://bearstudio.fr/).

## Motivation
There are a lot of features that are common among web or mobile applications, such as uploading a file to S3 bucket or allow
payments using Stripe. What we try to achieve here, is to have a code base and code samples to develop faster for our new
clients, with as much features examples as possible.

## Roadmap
- [ ]  CSV file import
- [ ]  CSV file export
- [ ]  Stripe checkout payment
- [ ]  Stripe connect payment and flow
- [ ]  File upload on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) S3 bucket (also on [CleverCloud](https://clever-cloud.com) Cella)
- [ ]  Social auth login (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, ...)
- [ ]  Cloudinary file upload
- [ ]  Branded emails
- [ ]  OneSignal notification sending
- [ ]  CleverCloud fsbucket file reading
- [ ]  Invoice generation using InvoiceFactory
- [ ]  User's additional fields using JHipster
- [ ]  Feign API client integration
- [ ]  Date and time manipulation utilities
- [ ]  CI / CD integration
- [ ]  Web socket connection
